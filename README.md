# LearnPath ‚Äì Structured Roadmap Learning Platform

LearnPath is a full‚Äëstack learning platform for publishing structured learning roadmaps composed of modules and tasks. Users can enrol, track granular progress, and (prototype) earn badges/certificates. A single protected admin account can create and manage roadmaps, modules, and tasks through an integrated dashboard.

## ‚ú® Current Feature Set

### End User (Learner)
* Browse all published roadmaps with module & task counts.
* View roadmap detail: modules, tasks, resources, completion percentage.
* Start a roadmap (creates row in `user_roadmaps`).
* Toggle task completion (persisted in `user_progress`).
* Track aggregated stats (started, completed, tasks done, earned badges/certs).
* See recent activity feed (task completions, roadmap starts).
* View active (in‚Äëprogress) roadmaps with progress bars.
* Request badge / certificate after full completion (server validates; placeholder URLs issued).
* Update profile (username, email, password change optional).

### Administrator (Single Admin Account)
* Authenticates like a user; role gate applied via middleware + UI gating.
* Dashboard statistics (counts of users, roadmaps, modules, tasks, completions, issued badges/certs).
* Create / edit / delete roadmaps.
* Add / edit / delete modules within a roadmap (order maintained via incremental order_index).
* Add / edit / delete tasks with descriptions & external resource links.

### Security & Access Control
* JWT (24h expiry) signed with configurable secret.
* Middleware: `authenticateToken` + `requireAdmin`.
* UI gating: protected pages cannot be accessed after logout or without role.
* Parameterized SQL queries (mysql2) to prevent injection.
* Bcrypt password hashing.

---
## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5 served statically from `public/`.
* **Backend**: Express REST API (`server.js`).
* **Database**: MySQL; schema in `schema.sql` with relational integrity & cascading deletes for modules/tasks.
* **Auth Storage**: JWT stored in `localStorage` (simple SPA approach).
* **State**: In-browser JS manages current user, progress map, rendered views.

### Data Model (Textual ER Outline)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
* Node.js 16+ (tested on 18+ recommended)
* MySQL 8+

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Initialize Database
```bash
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=learnpath_db
JWT_SECRET=change_me_in_production
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Run
```bash
npm start    # or: npm run dev (with nodemon)
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000

## üë§ Default Accounts (Seed Data)
| Role | Email | Password | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Admin | admin@learnpath.com | password123 | Single admin account (enforced in seed) |
| User  | john.doe@example.com | password123 | Sample learner |

‚ö†Ô∏è Change / rotate these credentials immediately for any non-local deployment.

---
## üîê Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials ‚Üí `/api/login`.
2. Server validates & returns JWT + minimal user object.
3. Frontend stores token & user in `localStorage`.
4. All protected requests send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
5. Logout clears storage & resets UI (no placeholder user).

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Interaction Model
Single `index.html` containing multiple logical "pages" toggled via JS (`showPage`). No build tooling yet; all logic consolidated in `public/js/app.js`.

---
## üß™ Testing
* `integration-test.js` exercises: admin login ‚Üí create user ‚Üí login user ‚Üí start roadmap ‚Üí update progress.
* Future: add Jest or Vitest + Supertest for unit + route tests.

---
## üîí Security Considerations
Implemented:
* Bcrypt password hashing.
* JWT expiration (24h).
* Parameterized queries.
* Role enforcement middleware.
* Logout clearing local state + gated UI.

Planned / Recommended:
* Rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit) for auth + mutation endpoints.
* Password reset + email verification.
* Audit logging of admin actions.
* HTTPS enforcement + secure cookie option (if switching from localStorage).
* CSP / security headers (helmet middleware).

---
## üöÄ Deployment Notes
* Behind reverse proxy (NGINX) serve static files + forward `/api/*`.
* Set strong `JWT_SECRET` and rotate periodically.
* Run DB migrations (currently single schema file; consider migration tool).
* Enable backup & monitoring (metric collection for usage growth).

---
## üìà Performance & Scalability
Current:
* Simple pooled MySQL connections (mysql2 pool).
* Roadmap listing does aggregate counts in one query.

Future Enhancements:
* Add indices on foreign keys & high-read columns (some implicit via FK; explicit composite indexes for activity queries could help).
* Pagination & server-side filtering for `/api/roadmaps` once dataset grows.
* Caching layer (Redis) for admin stats & roadmap lists.

## ‚úÖ Summary
LearnPath currently delivers a functional single-admin roadmap learning experience with progress tracking, statistics, and prototype credential issuance. The foundation is solid for expanding into richer credentialing, multi-role collaboration, and production hardening (security, tests, performance). See the roadmap above for the prioritized evolution path.

Happy building & learning! üéì
