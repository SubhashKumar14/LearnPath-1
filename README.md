# LearnPath ‚Äì Structured Roadmap Learning Platform

LearnPath is a lightweight full‚Äëstack learning platform for publishing and tracking structured learning roadmaps (‚Üí modules ‚Üí tasks). Learners enrol, toggle granular task completion, and (prototype) request badges/certificates after finishing a roadmap. A single protected admin account manages all roadmap content through the same SPA UX. The stack intentionally stays minimal (Express + MySQL + Vanilla JS) to maximize clarity and approachability.

## ‚ú® Current Feature Set

### End User (Learner)
* Browse all published roadmaps with module & task counts.
* View roadmap detail: modules, tasks, resources, completion percentage.
* Start a roadmap (creates row in `user_roadmaps`).
* Toggle task completion (persisted in `user_progress`).
* Track aggregated stats (started, completed, tasks done, earned badges/certs).
* See recent activity feed (task completions, roadmap starts).
* View active (in‚Äëprogress) roadmaps with progress bars.
* Request badge / certificate after full completion (server validates; placeholder URLs issued).
* Update profile (username, email, password change optional).

### Administrator (Single Admin Account)
* Authenticates like a user; role gate applied via middleware + UI gating.
* Dashboard statistics (counts of users, roadmaps, modules, tasks, completions, issued badges/certs).
* Create / edit / delete roadmaps.
* Add / edit / delete modules within a roadmap (order maintained via incremental order_index).
* Add / edit / delete tasks with descriptions & external resource links.

### Security & Access Control
* JWT (24h expiry) signed with configurable secret.
* Middleware: `authenticateToken` + `requireAdmin`.
* UI gating: protected pages cannot be accessed after logout or without role.
* Parameterized SQL queries (mysql2) to prevent injection.
* Bcrypt password hashing.

---
## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5 served statically from `public/`.
* **Backend**: Express REST API (`server.js`).
* **Database**: MySQL; schema in `schema.sql` with relational integrity & cascading deletes for modules/tasks.
* **Auth Storage**: JWT stored in `localStorage` (simple SPA approach).
* **State**: In-browser JS manages current user, progress map, rendered views.

### Data Model (Textual ER Outline)
```
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< roadmaps.created_by
roadmaps (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< modules (cascade)
modules (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< tasks (cascade)
users (M) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< user_progress >‚îÄ‚îÄ (M) tasks  (completion per task)
users (M) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< user_roadmaps >‚îÄ‚îÄ (M) roadmaps (enrolment/start)
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< certificates (per roadmap)
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< badges (per roadmap)
```

## üìÇ Repository Structure
```
server.js               # Express API & all route handlers (monolithic entry point)
auth_middleware.js      # JWT verification + admin role gate helpers
db.js                   # MySQL connection pool (mysql2) + initial connectivity check
schema.sql              # Canonical schema + seed + optional prototype tables
public/index.html       # SPA shell (sections shown/hidden via JS)
public/badge.html       # Placeholder badge asset page (prototype)
public/certificate.html # Placeholder certificate asset page (prototype)
public/js/app.js        # Front-end controller: auth, rendering, admin CRUD, progress
public/css/style.css    # Minimal custom styles over Bootstrap
package.json            # Scripts + deps
setup.sh                # Convenience setup script (Linux/macOS) ‚Äì optional
```

Removed legacy helper/test scripts after consolidation (see git history for reference).

### File Responsibility Matrix (Quick View)
| Layer | File(s) | Core Responsibilities |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------- |
| API Routing | `server.js` | Define endpoints, compose middleware, run queries |
| Auth | `auth_middleware.js` | Decode JWT, attach user, enforce admin role |
| Data Access | `db.js` | Provide pooled connection (promise API) |
| Schema | `schema.sql` | DDL + seeds + optional experimental tables |
| Frontend State | `public/js/app.js` | LocalStorage auth, DOM rendering, fetch orchestration |
| Presentation | `public/*.html`, `public/css/style.css` | Static markup & styling |

---
## üîë Environment Variables
Create a `.env` (keys are read via `process.env` ‚Äì ensure you load them before starting if you add dotenv):
| Variable | Required | Default (implicit) | Purpose |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| DB_HOST | ‚úÖ | localhost | MySQL host |
| DB_USER | ‚úÖ | root | MySQL user |
| DB_PASSWORD | ‚úÖ | ‚Äì | MySQL password |
| DB_NAME | ‚úÖ | learnpath_db | Database name (schema assumes this) |
| JWT_SECRET | ‚úÖ | ‚Äì | HMAC signing key for JWTs |
| PORT | ‚è∫ | 3000 | Server listen port |

If you need dotenv support, install and add at top of `server.js`:
```js
// require('dotenv').config();
```

---
## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (Core Tables)
Core production‚Äërelevant tables (prototype tables excluded here):

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns / Notes |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------- |
| users | Account identities | `role` ENUM('user','admin'); unique `email` |
| roadmaps | Top-level learning tracks | FK `created_by -> users.id` |
| modules | Ordered groups within a roadmap | Cascade delete on roadmap removal |
| tasks | Atomic actionable learning items | Optional `resource_url`; ordered per module |
| user_progress | Per-task completion state | Unique (`user_id`,`task_id`); stores timestamp |
| user_roadmaps | User enrolments | `started_at`, optional `completed_at` |
| certificates | Issued certificates (prototype asset URL) | One per (user, roadmap) scenario |
| badges | Issued badges (prototype asset URL) | One per (user, roadmap) scenario |

Prototype / optional extension tables: `badge_requests`, `certificate_requests`, `courses`, `course_modules`, `lessons`, `user_courses`, `lesson_progress`.

### Integrity & Constraints Highlights
* Cascade deletes from `modules` ‚Üí `tasks` ensure cleanup.
* Unique key on `user_progress(user_id, task_id)` enables idempotent upsert semantics.
* No soft deletes; physical removal assumed (simple model).

### Suggested Future Indices
| Table | Index | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | --------- |
| user_progress | (user_id) | Fast per-user progress aggregation |
| user_progress | (task_id) | Task completion stats |
| user_roadmaps | (user_id, roadmap_id) | Accelerate completion lookups |

---
## üîÑ Typical Request Flow (Example: Toggle Task Completion)
1. User clicks checkbox in UI.
2. `app.js` sends `POST /api/progress/task` with `{ taskId, completed }` + `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
3. `authenticateToken` decodes token ‚Üí attaches `req.user`.
4. Handler performs upsert logic (INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE) in `user_progress`.
5. Returns confirmation JSON; UI updates progress bar & activity feed.

---
## üß™ Testing Strategy (Planned)
Current state: No automated tests after cleanup (legacy scripts removed).

Planned layers:
1. Unit: Pure functions (if refactored out of route handlers).
2. API: Supertest against in‚Äëmemory (or ephemeral) MySQL (possibly using Docker + migrations).
3. Smoke: Startup + `/api/health` + seed account login.
4. Future CI: GitHub Actions matrix (Node LTS versions) + lint + coverage threshold.

## üßæ Representative JSON Payloads
### Login Response
```json
{
	"token": "<jwt>",
	"user": {"id":1, "username":"admin", "email":"admin@learnpath.com", "role":"admin"}
}
```
### Roadmap Detail (abridged)
```json
{
	"id":1,
	"title":"Data Structures & Algorithms",
	"modules":[{
		"id":10,
		"title":"Arrays & Strings",
		"tasks":[{"id":55, "title":"Introduction to Arrays", "completed":true}]
	}]
}
```

## üîê Security Deep Dive
Implemented controls:
* JWT bearer auth (HMAC) ‚Äì no refresh token layer yet.
* Password hashing: bcrypt cost factor 10 (configurable).
* Parameterized queries via mysql2 prepared statements.
* Role guarding (single admin) both server and client side.
* Logout thoroughly purges localStorage & hides protected UI.

Risks / gaps (future work):
* No rate limiting ‚Üí brute force risk on `/api/login`.
* No account lockout or MFA.
* Token stored in localStorage (susceptible to XSS if introduced) ‚Äì consider httpOnly cookies.
* No CSRF protection (not critical with bearer header + same‚Äëorigin static serving but relevant if migrating to cookies).
* No password policy / complexity checks.

---
## üèóÔ∏è Deployment & Ops Checklist
| Concern | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| Secrets | Set strong `JWT_SECRET` via env store (Vault/Secrets Manager) |
| DB Migrations | Move from monolithic `schema.sql` to tool (Prisma, Knex, Flyway) |
| Logging | Add structured logger (pino/winston) + request IDs |
| Monitoring | Add health probes + metrics exporter |
| Backups | Automate MySQL dumps / point‚Äëin‚Äëtime recovery |
| HTTPS | Terminate TLS at reverse proxy (NGINX/Caddy) |

---
## üß© Extensibility Points
| Area | Enhancement Idea |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Content Types | Add quizzes / coding challenges table |
| Credentialing | Real badge image generation + certificate PDF pipeline |
| Analytics | Per‚Äëtask completion heatmaps, retention cohorts |
| Roles | Instructor role for delegated content management |
| Frontend | Modularize `app.js` (ESM) + build with Vite/Rollup |

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| 500 on any DB route | DB not reachable | Verify env vars & MySQL running |
| Login always 401 | Wrong seed hash or user missing | Rerun `schema.sql` seeding |
| Progress not saving | Unique constraint failing silently | Check `user_progress` unique index exists |
| Admin UI hidden after refresh | Token expired | Re-login (24h expiry) |

---
## üß≠ Roadmap (Refined Milestones)
1. Security hardening (rate limiting, password reset, token refresh).
2. Automated test harness (Supertest + Jest) + CI pipeline.
3. Real credential asset generation service.
4. Frontend modular refactor & accessibility audit.
5. Multi-role & instructor authoring workflows.

---
## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Interaction Model
Single `index.html` containing multiple logical "pages" toggled via JS (`showPage`). No build tooling yet; all logic consolidated in `public/js/app.js`.

---
## üß™ Testing
* `integration-test.js` exercises: admin login ‚Üí create user ‚Üí login user ‚Üí start roadmap ‚Üí update progress.
* Future: add Jest or Vitest + Supertest for unit + route tests.

---
## üîí Security Considerations
Implemented:
* Bcrypt password hashing.
* JWT expiration (24h).
* Parameterized queries.
* Role enforcement middleware.
* Logout clearing local state + gated UI.

Planned / Recommended:
* Rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit) for auth + mutation endpoints.
* Password reset + email verification.
* Audit logging of admin actions.
* HTTPS enforcement + secure cookie option (if switching from localStorage).
* CSP / security headers (helmet middleware).

---
## üöÄ Deployment Notes
* Behind reverse proxy (NGINX) serve static files + forward `/api/*`.
* Set strong `JWT_SECRET` and rotate periodically.
* Run DB migrations (currently single schema file; consider migration tool).
* Enable backup & monitoring (metric collection for usage growth).

---
## üìà Performance & Scalability
Current:
* Simple pooled MySQL connections (mysql2 pool).
* Roadmap listing does aggregate counts in one query.

Future Enhancements:
* Add indices on foreign keys & high-read columns (some implicit via FK; explicit composite indexes for activity queries could help).
* Pagination & server-side filtering for `/api/roadmaps` once dataset grows.
* Caching layer (Redis) for admin stats & roadmap lists.

---
## üó∫Ô∏è Product Roadmap (Next Steps)
| Priority | Item | Rationale |
| -------- | ---- | --------- |
| High | Password reset + email verification | Account security |
| High | Proper badge/certificate asset generation (PDF/PNG) | User motivation |
| High | Unit & API test coverage + CI workflow | Reliability |
| Medium | Pagination & search on roadmaps | Scalability |
| Medium | Role expansion (multiple admins / instructors) | Growth |
| Medium | Rich analytics (per-module completion curves) | Insight |
| Medium | Frontend modular refactor + build (ESM bundling) | Maintainability |
| Low | Internationalization (i18n) | Global reach |
| Low | Dark mode & accessibility audits (WCAG) | UX inclusivity |
| Low | Notification system (email / in-app) | Engagement |
