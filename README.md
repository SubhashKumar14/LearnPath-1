# üìä Project Plan vs Implementation Status (Conversation-Derived Summary)
This section was generated from the full build conversation. It reconciles what you originally planned, what has been delivered, and what remains (explicitly mentioned or implicitly agreed) so future contributors have instant project context.

### 1. Originally Planned / Requested
Core functional asks:
* Single administrator model (only one admin user in system).
* Admin-only functionality strictly gated (UI + backend middleware).
* Dynamic profile avatar initials derived from first (or full) username instead of placeholder "JD".
* Reliable logout: clear session state, remove any default user artifacts, redirect / gate protected screens.
* Comprehensive README with architecture + usage + API overview.
* Consolidate scattered SQL fragments (fix-admin, update-schema, etc.) into a single authoritative `schema.sql` file.
* Remove legacy / test / helper SQL and JS scripts after consolidation.
* Clean repository footprint to essentials only.

Enhancement / forward-looking items raised during discussion:
* Proper automated test suite (unit + integration) & future CI pipeline.
* Password reset & email verification flows.
* Real badge & certificate asset generation (PDF/PNG) instead of placeholder URLs.
* Multi-admin / instructor / role expansion model (beyond single admin).
* Rate limiting + audit logging + stronger security headers.
* Frontend modularization (split `app.js`, introduce bundler) + accessibility improvements.
* Database migration strategy (move beyond monolithic schema file).
* Analytics & richer stats (per-module progress trends, completion curves).
* Pagination, search, filtering for large roadmap sets.
* Internationalization (i18n), dark mode, notification system (email / in-app), user engagement features.
* LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING guidelines addition.
* Potential shift of JWT storage to httpOnly cookies for improved security.

### 2. Delivered (Implemented & Verified)
* Single admin account seeded & enforced (`role='admin'`).
* Middleware-based role gating (`authenticateToken`, `requireAdmin`) + UI hiding of admin panels.
* Dynamic avatar initials generation in frontend (`getUserInitials` logic in `app.js`).
* Hardened logout: clears localStorage, hides protected sections, prevents phantom access.
* Expanded, detailed README (architecture, schema, API, security, troubleshooting, roadmap).
* Unified `schema.sql` containing base schema, seeds, password hash fix, optional prototype tables.
* Removal of deprecated test/helper files (integration & test scripts, auxiliary SQL, setup helpers) ‚Äî repository slimmed.
* Badge / certificate request endpoints (prototype issuing logic with placeholder asset URLs).
* Admin dashboard statistics endpoint & UI integration.
* Progress tracking (task-level) & activity feed endpoints.
* Roadmap/module/task CRUD with ordered hierarchy.
* Profile fetch/update endpoints with password hashing.
* Readme further enhanced with deployment, security, extensibility, troubleshooting matrices.

### 3. Partially Addressed / Foundations Laid
* Prototype credential tables (`badges`, `certificates`) exist; real asset generation not yet implemented.
* Optional prototype tables for courses & lessons created (not yet wired to API routes).
* Basic security (bcrypt, JWT expiry, parameterized queries) present; advanced controls pending.

### 4. Outstanding / Future (Explicitly Discussed but Not Yet Implemented)
Security & Auth:
* Rate limiting, audit logging, stronger password policies, password reset, email verification, potential MFA.
* JWT refresh / rotation strategy & migration from localStorage to httpOnly secure cookies.

Testing & Quality:
* Automated unit/API test suite (Jest/Vitest + Supertest) & coverage thresholds.
* CI workflow (GitHub Actions) for build/lint/test gates.

Content & Features:
* Multi-admin / instructor roles & delegated content workflows.
* Course / lesson API endpoints leveraging prototype tables.
* Search, pagination, filtering for roadmaps and tasks.
* Analytics dashboards (engagement, completion funnels, per-module curves).
* Notification & email system (progress milestones, credential issuance).
* Real badge image & certificate PDF generation pipeline (possibly microservice or library integration).

Frontend & UX:
* Modular refactor of `public/js/app.js` (ES modules + bundler like Vite/Rollup).
* Accessibility audit (WCAG), dark mode, i18n framework integration.
* Componentization / state management improvements.

Data & Operations:
* Migration tooling (Prisma / Knex / Flyway) to replace monolithic schema file.
* Additional indexing & query optimization for scale.
* Structured logging, metrics, and health/observability stack.
* Backup automation & disaster recovery playbook.

Governance & Compliance:
* Add `LICENSE` file (MIT planned) & `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.
* Security policy / responsible disclosure doc.

### 5. Notable Architectural Decisions
* Chose single-admin simplicity over multi-role complexity for MVP speed.
* Vanilla JS SPA (no framework) to minimize onboarding complexity ‚Äî tradeoff: larger `app.js` file and reduced modularity.
* Monolithic Express file (`server.js`) for velocity; planned future extraction into route modules/services.
* Single consolidated schema over incremental migrations ‚Äî acceptable for early stage, flagged for change.
* LocalStorage JWT storage for simplicity with understanding of XSS tradeoffs (roadmap includes mitigation path).

### 6. Technical Debt / Risk Hotspots
| Area | Risk | Mitigation Path |
| ---- | ---- | --------------- |
| Auth brute force | No rate limiting | Add `express-rate-limit` + account lock logic |
| Token storage | XSS exposure potential | Move to httpOnly secure cookies + CSP & Helmet |
| Large server file | Maintainability | Refactor into routers/controllers/services |
| Lack of tests | Regression risk | Introduce Jest + Supertest early |
| Schema evolution | Manual edits risk drift | Adopt migration tool |

### 7. Immediate Next Step Suggestions (Actionable Shortlist)
1. Add LICENSE + CONTRIBUTING to formalize repo.
2. Introduce Jest + Supertest smoke tests (login, create roadmap, toggle progress).
3. Apply `helmet` + `express-rate-limit` for quick security uplift.
4. Split `server.js` into `routes/` modules incrementally.
5. Implement real credential generation placeholder service interface (contract first).

# LearnPath ‚Äì Structured Roadmap Learning Platform

LearnPath is a lightweight full‚Äëstack learning platform for publishing and tracking structured learning roadmaps (‚Üí modules ‚Üí tasks). Learners enrol, toggle granular task completion, and (prototype) request badges/certificates after finishing a roadmap. A single protected admin account manages all roadmap content through the same SPA UX. The stack intentionally stays minimal (Express + MySQL + Vanilla JS) to maximize clarity and approachability.

---

## ‚ú® Current Feature Set

### End User (Learner)
* Browse all published roadmaps with module & task counts.
* View roadmap detail: modules, tasks, resources, completion percentage.
* Start a roadmap (creates row in `user_roadmaps`).
* Toggle task completion (persisted in `user_progress`).
* Track aggregated stats (started, completed, tasks done, earned badges/certs).
* See recent activity feed (task completions, roadmap starts).
* View active (in‚Äëprogress) roadmaps with progress bars.
* Request badge / certificate after full completion (server validates; placeholder URLs issued).
* Update profile (username, email, password change optional).

### Administrator (Single Admin Account)
* Authenticates like a user; role gate applied via middleware + UI gating.
* Dashboard statistics (counts of users, roadmaps, modules, tasks, completions, issued badges/certs).
* Create / edit / delete roadmaps.
* Add / edit / delete modules within a roadmap (order maintained via incremental order_index).
* Add / edit / delete tasks with descriptions & external resource links.

### Security & Access Control
* JWT (24h expiry) signed with configurable secret.
* Middleware: `authenticateToken` + `requireAdmin`.
* UI gating: protected pages cannot be accessed after logout or without role.
* Parameterized SQL queries (mysql2) to prevent injection.
* Bcrypt password hashing.

---
## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5 served statically from `public/`.
* **Backend**: Express REST API (`server.js`).
* **Database**: MySQL; schema in `schema.sql` with relational integrity & cascading deletes for modules/tasks.
* **Auth Storage**: JWT stored in `localStorage` (simple SPA approach).
* **State**: In-browser JS manages current user, progress map, rendered views.

### Data Model (Textual ER Outline)
```
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< roadmaps.created_by
roadmaps (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< modules (cascade)
modules (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< tasks (cascade)
users (M) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< user_progress >‚îÄ‚îÄ (M) tasks  (completion per task)
users (M) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< user_roadmaps >‚îÄ‚îÄ (M) roadmaps (enrolment/start)
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< certificates (per roadmap)
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ< badges (per roadmap)
```

## üìÇ Repository Structure
```
server.js               # Express API & all route handlers (monolithic entry point)
auth_middleware.js      # JWT verification + admin role gate helpers
db.js                   # MySQL connection pool (mysql2) + initial connectivity check
schema.sql              # Canonical schema + seed + optional prototype tables
public/index.html       # SPA shell (sections shown/hidden via JS)
public/badge.html       # Placeholder badge asset page (prototype)
public/certificate.html # Placeholder certificate asset page (prototype)
public/js/app.js        # Front-end controller: auth, rendering, admin CRUD, progress
public/css/style.css    # Minimal custom styles over Bootstrap
package.json            # Scripts + deps
setup.sh                # Convenience setup script (Linux/macOS) ‚Äì optional
```

Removed legacy helper/test scripts after consolidation (see git history for reference).

### File Responsibility Matrix (Quick View)
| Layer | File(s) | Core Responsibilities |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------- |
| API Routing | `server.js` | Define endpoints, compose middleware, run queries |
| Auth | `auth_middleware.js` | Decode JWT, attach user, enforce admin role |
| Data Access | `db.js` | Provide pooled connection (promise API) |
| Schema | `schema.sql` | DDL + seeds + optional experimental tables |
| Frontend State | `public/js/app.js` | LocalStorage auth, DOM rendering, fetch orchestration |
| Presentation | `public/*.html`, `public/css/style.css` | Static markup & styling |

---
## üîë Environment Variables
Create a `.env` (keys are read via `process.env` ‚Äì ensure you load them before starting if you add dotenv):
| Variable | Required | Default (implicit) | Purpose |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| DB_HOST | ‚úÖ | localhost | MySQL host |
| DB_USER | ‚úÖ | root | MySQL user |
| DB_PASSWORD | ‚úÖ | ‚Äì | MySQL password |
| DB_NAME | ‚úÖ | learnpath_db | Database name (schema assumes this) |
| JWT_SECRET | ‚úÖ | ‚Äì | HMAC signing key for JWTs |
| PORT | ‚è∫ | 3000 | Server listen port |

If you need dotenv support, install and add at top of `server.js`:
```js
// require('dotenv').config();
```

---
## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (Core Tables)
Core production‚Äërelevant tables (prototype tables excluded here):

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns / Notes |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------- |
| users | Account identities | `role` ENUM('user','admin'); unique `email` |
| roadmaps | Top-level learning tracks | FK `created_by -> users.id` |
| modules | Ordered groups within a roadmap | Cascade delete on roadmap removal |
| tasks | Atomic actionable learning items | Optional `resource_url`; ordered per module |
| user_progress | Per-task completion state | Unique (`user_id`,`task_id`); stores timestamp |
| user_roadmaps | User enrolments | `started_at`, optional `completed_at` |
| certificates | Issued certificates (prototype asset URL) | One per (user, roadmap) scenario |
| badges | Issued badges (prototype asset URL) | One per (user, roadmap) scenario |

Prototype / optional extension tables: `badge_requests`, `certificate_requests`, `courses`, `course_modules`, `lessons`, `user_courses`, `lesson_progress`.

### Integrity & Constraints Highlights
* Cascade deletes from `modules` ‚Üí `tasks` ensure cleanup.
* Unique key on `user_progress(user_id, task_id)` enables idempotent upsert semantics.
* No soft deletes; physical removal assumed (simple model).

### Suggested Future Indices
| Table | Index | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | --------- |
| user_progress | (user_id) | Fast per-user progress aggregation |
| user_progress | (task_id) | Task completion stats |
| user_roadmaps | (user_id, roadmap_id) | Accelerate completion lookups |

---
## üîÑ Typical Request Flow (Example: Toggle Task Completion)
1. User clicks checkbox in UI.
2. `app.js` sends `POST /api/progress/task` with `{ taskId, completed }` + `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
3. `authenticateToken` decodes token ‚Üí attaches `req.user`.
4. Handler performs upsert logic (INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE) in `user_progress`.
5. Returns confirmation JSON; UI updates progress bar & activity feed.

---
## üß™ Testing Strategy (Planned)
Current state: No automated tests after cleanup (legacy scripts removed).

Planned layers:
1. Unit: Pure functions (if refactored out of route handlers).
2. API: Supertest against in‚Äëmemory (or ephemeral) MySQL (possibly using Docker + migrations).
3. Smoke: Startup + `/api/health` + seed account login.
4. Future CI: GitHub Actions matrix (Node LTS versions) + lint + coverage threshold.

---
## üì° API Surface (Condensed with Status Codes)
Below is a concise list (see comments in `server.js` for live source of truth):

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | 2xx | Common 4xx/5xx |
| ------ | -------- | ---- | --- | -------------- |
| POST | /api/register | Public | 201 | 400 (email exists) |
| POST | /api/login | Public | 200 | 401 (bad creds) |
| GET | /api/profile | User | 200 | 401 (no token) |
| PUT | /api/profile | User | 200 | 400/401 |
| GET | /api/roadmaps | Public | 200 | ‚Äì |
| GET | /api/roadmaps/:id | Public | 200 | 404 |
| POST | /api/roadmaps | Admin | 201 | 401/403/400 |
| PUT | /api/roadmaps/:id | Admin | 200 | 404 |
| DELETE | /api/roadmaps/:id | Admin | 204 | 404 |
| POST | /api/roadmaps/:id/start | User | 201 | 404 |
| GET | /api/roadmaps/:id/progress | User | 200 | 404 |
| POST | /api/modules/:roadmapId/modules | Admin | 201 | 404 |

| POST | /api/certificates/request | User | 201 | 400 (incomplete) |
| GET | /api/health | Public | 200 | 500 (DB down) |

---
## üßæ Representative JSON Payloads
### Login Response
```json
{
	"token": "<jwt>",
	"user": {"id":1, "username":"admin", "email":"admin@learnpath.com", "role":"admin"}
}
```
### Roadmap Detail (abridged)
```json
{
	"id":1,
	"title":"Data Structures & Algorithms",
	"modules":[{
		"id":10,
		"title":"Arrays & Strings",
		"tasks":[{"id":55, "title":"Introduction to Arrays", "completed":true}]
	}]
}
```

---
## üîê Security Deep Dive
Implemented controls:
* JWT bearer auth (HMAC) ‚Äì no refresh token layer yet.
* Password hashing: bcrypt cost factor 10 (configurable).
* Parameterized queries via mysql2 prepared statements.
* Role guarding (single admin) both server and client side.
* Logout thoroughly purges localStorage & hides protected UI.

Risks / gaps (future work):
* No rate limiting ‚Üí brute force risk on `/api/login`.
* No account lockout or MFA.
* Token stored in localStorage (susceptible to XSS if introduced) ‚Äì consider httpOnly cookies.
* No CSRF protection (not critical with bearer header + same‚Äëorigin static serving but relevant if migrating to cookies).
* No password policy / complexity checks.

---
## üèóÔ∏è Deployment & Ops Checklist
| Concern | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| Secrets | Set strong `JWT_SECRET` via env store (Vault/Secrets Manager) |
| DB Migrations | Move from monolithic `schema.sql` to tool (Prisma, Knex, Flyway) |
| Logging | Add structured logger (pino/winston) + request IDs |
| Monitoring | Add health probes + metrics exporter |
| Backups | Automate MySQL dumps / point‚Äëin‚Äëtime recovery |
| HTTPS | Terminate TLS at reverse proxy (NGINX/Caddy) |

---
## üß© Extensibility Points
| Area | Enhancement Idea |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Content Types | Add quizzes / coding challenges table |
| Credentialing | Real badge image generation + certificate PDF pipeline |
| Analytics | Per‚Äëtask completion heatmaps, retention cohorts |
| Roles | Instructor role for delegated content management |
| Frontend | Modularize `app.js` (ESM) + build with Vite/Rollup |

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| 500 on any DB route | DB not reachable | Verify env vars & MySQL running |
| Login always 401 | Wrong seed hash or user missing | Rerun `schema.sql` seeding |
| Progress not saving | Unique constraint failing silently | Check `user_progress` unique index exists |
| Admin UI hidden after refresh | Token expired | Re-login (24h expiry) |

---
## üß≠ Roadmap (Refined Milestones)
1. Security hardening (rate limiting, password reset, token refresh).
2. Automated test harness (Supertest + Jest) + CI pipeline.
3. Real credential asset generation service.
4. Frontend modular refactor & accessibility audit.
5. Multi-role & instructor authoring workflows.

---
## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Interaction Model
Single `index.html` containing multiple logical "pages" toggled via JS (`showPage`). No build tooling yet; all logic consolidated in `public/js/app.js`.

---
## üß™ Testing
* `integration-test.js` exercises: admin login ‚Üí create user ‚Üí login user ‚Üí start roadmap ‚Üí update progress.
* Future: add Jest or Vitest + Supertest for unit + route tests.

---
## üîí Security Considerations
Implemented:
* Bcrypt password hashing.
* JWT expiration (24h).
* Parameterized queries.
* Role enforcement middleware.
* Logout clearing local state + gated UI.

Planned / Recommended:
* Rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit) for auth + mutation endpoints.
* Password reset + email verification.
* Audit logging of admin actions.
* HTTPS enforcement + secure cookie option (if switching from localStorage).
* CSP / security headers (helmet middleware).

---
## üöÄ Deployment Notes
* Behind reverse proxy (NGINX) serve static files + forward `/api/*`.
* Set strong `JWT_SECRET` and rotate periodically.
* Run DB migrations (currently single schema file; consider migration tool).
* Enable backup & monitoring (metric collection for usage growth).

---
## üìà Performance & Scalability
Current:
* Simple pooled MySQL connections (mysql2 pool).
* Roadmap listing does aggregate counts in one query.

Future Enhancements:
* Add indices on foreign keys & high-read columns (some implicit via FK; explicit composite indexes for activity queries could help).
* Pagination & server-side filtering for `/api/roadmaps` once dataset grows.
* Caching layer (Redis) for admin stats & roadmap lists.

---
## üó∫Ô∏è Product Roadmap (Next Steps)
| Priority | Item | Rationale |
| -------- | ---- | --------- |
| High | Password reset + email verification | Account security |
| High | Proper badge/certificate asset generation (PDF/PNG) | User motivation |
| High | Unit & API test coverage + CI workflow | Reliability |
| Medium | Pagination & search on roadmaps | Scalability |
| Medium | Role expansion (multiple admins / instructors) | Growth |
| Medium | Rich analytics (per-module completion curves) | Insight |
| Medium | Frontend modular refactor + build (ESM bundling) | Maintainability |
| Low | Internationalization (i18n) | Global reach |
| Low | Dark mode & accessibility audits (WCAG) | UX inclusivity |
| Low | Notification system (email / in-app) | Engagement |

---
